# Drone
Repository for the fall 2016 Drone project

This project consists of two parts. There is arduino code that recieves serial input and sends values to PWM pins connected directly to the original quadcopter controller. The other component is currently done in processing which takes some kind of input (it is set up to take video and keyboard input at the moment) and turns that into controller input values that are sent over serial to the arduino.
